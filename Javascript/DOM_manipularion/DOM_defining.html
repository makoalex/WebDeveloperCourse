  <div>
    <p> DOM- <b>Document Object Model</b>- is the interface between the Javascript and the HTML and CSS.<br> It's Javascript objects and functions that we can use to interact with our Html and Css.</p>
    <p> when a webpage is loaded the browser creates a <b>Document Object Model </b> of the page. <br>  It is an object riented representation of the page which can be modified with a  scripting  language such as Javascript.</p>
    <p>A webpage is a document, that can be either displayed in the browser window, or as a HTML source . The DOM represents that same document so it can be manipulated. </p>
